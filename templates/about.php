            <p class="lead">
            Here at Blue Jeans Investing we believe that more blue jeans wearing blue collar workers should
            have the information available to them to invest in the stock market. The stock market should not only be
            limited to rich, white collar investors that for so long has taken advantage of the hard working American blue collar
            workers.</p>

            <h2>This Is Our Story</h2>

            <p>
            With 200 bucks and an E trade account, Derek made his first trade all those years ago. Selling for a loss, he quickly realized that when your playing with real money, the emotions are vastly different than those playing with paper money. From this point on, he embarked on adventure that at times has brought great happiness and other times great sorrow. After getting the lay of the land, Derek realized how manipulative Wall St really is.

            <p>
           From that moment on, he decided that most hard working Americans are ill-equipped to see the manipulation that Wall St has to offer. After performing several back tests, and gathering as most data as one human could possibly gather, he concluded that todays indicators simply do not perform in the markets like they did decades ago when they were invented. Maybe it was the high-frequency trading, or all the algorithmic trading that goes on in todays Wall St that was not present all those decades ago. With reasons unknown, he set forth on a mission to spread the word that most retail investors are simply losing money because of out of date indicators.
